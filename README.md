# XBPS Packages

## Description

This repository contains a collection of templates for xbps-src and Void Linux. These templates provide packaging information for software that cannot be accepted in the official voidlinux-packages repository according to the manual. The templates mainly include binary repacks for browsers and proprietary software, themes, fonts, beta or -git versions for programs.

Some of the templates were proposed to void-packages and rejected. Since they are still being used by the contributors, they are being maintained in this repository. Anyone who wants to contribute is welcome.

## Usage

To use the templates, follow these steps:

1. Clone the void-packages repository.
2. Copy the relevant directories inside srcpkgs/.
3. Follow the standard procedure for building and installing a package.
4. It is recommended to create a separate branch for the templates.
